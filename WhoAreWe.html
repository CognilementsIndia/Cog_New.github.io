          We are a Customer Experience Design and Consultancy firm, specialising in research, design and building of digital first solutions to empower enterprises with a digital customer experience that just works.<br><br>
          Cognilements was founded by Samudragupta Talukdar in the year 2018 as a Business Consultancy Firm to drive “growth” and “vision” of various businesses. The idea of Cognilements was to bring the best of the corporate world to the MSME (Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises), SME (Small and Medium Enterprises) and Corporate entities to drive their numbers. This would also include various strategies to take care of a major component called “Total Cost of Opportunity”.<br><br>
          We started our first project with Maharashtra's largest Travel and Logistics company "Prasanna Purple". Being a start-up consulting company our thought process was to join hands towards the growth and thus designed a solutions for the drivers which help them to boost their mileage of their vehicles.<br><br>
          To our learning we didnt ended up learning about the mileage but also the importance of "Customer Experience" as a service to boost your business. The solution not only helped them the objective of increasing profit margins but also allowed them to invest more on the Customer Experience part which was more service oriented.
